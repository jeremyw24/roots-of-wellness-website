    title: 'What is Chinese medicine?',
    answer:
      'Chinese medicine is a holistic health system that has been practiced for thousands of years. It focuses on understanding the root cause of health imbalances and restoring harmony within the body. This is achieved through various techniques, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping, gua sha, and lifestyle advice. By addressing the underlying issues rather than just the symptoms, Chinese medicine promotes long-term health and vitality.',

    title: 'What is acupuncture, and how does it work?',
    answer:
    'Acupuncture is a key component of Chinese medicine that involves the gentle insertion of fine, single-use needles into specific points on the body. These points help to regulate the flow of qi (energy), release tension, and promote natural healing. Acupuncture can address a wide range of conditions, from musculoskeletal pain to stress and digestive issues, by balancing the body’s systems.'

    title: "Does acupuncture hurt?",
    answer:
    'Many people associate needles with intense pain and are not aware that acupuncture needles are extremely thin and flexible. When inserted, they cause little or no discomfort. A feeling of tingling or heaviness may be felt as the needle contacts the Qi.'
  },

    id: 'faq-4',
    title: "Are there any side effects to acupuncture or herbal medicine?",
    answer:
      'Acupuncture and herbal medicine are generally safe when administered by a qualified practitioner. Some patients may experience mild side effects, such as slight bruising at the needle site or digestive changes when starting herbal remedies. These effects are typically short-lived. It\'s important to discuss any concerns with your practitioner.',

    id: 'faq-5',
    title: 'Do I have to use needles in my treatment?',
    answer:
      'Not at all! If you’re not comfortable with needles, there are many other effective techniques we can use. Treatments may include manual therapy, cupping, gua sha, or other non-needle methods to achieve the same goals of relieving tension, improving circulation, and restoring balance.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    title: 'What is manual therapy, and how is it used in Chinese medicine?',
    answer:
      'Manual therapy involves hands-on techniques such as massage, stretching, and joint mobilization to release tension, improve mobility, and support muscular health. At Roots of Wellness, manual therapy complements Chinese medicine techniques to provide a well-rounded and effective approach to care.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-7',
    title: 'What is cupping and gua sha?',
    answer:
    'Cupping is a technique that uses suction to improve circulation, release muscle tension, and encourage detoxification. Gua sha involves gentle scraping of the skin with a smooth tool to stimulate blood flow and reduce inflammation. Both methods are safe, effective, and tailored to your specific needs.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-8',
    title: 'What types of herbs do you use?',
    answer:
    'At Roots of Wellness, I use herbs that are primarily plant- and root-based, with some formulas including animal-derived ingredients.

    id: 'faq-9',
    title: 'What can I expect during my appointment?',

    'Your session is tailored to your unique needs. We’ll begin with a thorough consultation to understand your health history and goals. Based on this, I’ll create a treatment plan that may include acupuncture, manual therapy, cupping, gua sha, or a combination of these techniques.
